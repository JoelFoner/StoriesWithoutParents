CustomGrid
=========================

## Overview

This is a simple example of creating a grid. It displays stories that don't have the parent field 
set. It looks at the current project scope and filters the results accordingly.

Additionaly, if the page/dashboard this app is on includes an iteration or release filter, the 
grid will filter the appropriate stories accordingly
